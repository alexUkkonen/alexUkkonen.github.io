        <h1>Outerwilds</h1>
        <p>Outerwilds is one of the best examples of utilizing the singleplayer aspect of the game in game de-sign. In the game you are stuck in a time loop that lasts ca 20 minutes. The time loop always ends with the sun exploding and destroying the solar system. Trough the loops you gather information and try to find a way to save everyone. This makes the whole game a puzzle. The game has a lot of unique planets with new mechanics and puzzles and everywhere you find clues left by aliens eons ago. <br>
            While all of this is impressive in its own right the most impressive thing is the feeling of gravity that the planets exude. This impressive simulation of gravity is not unique, but it is extremely rare and what makes it so interesting is how they did it. So, what is the solution? It’s deceptively simple. The player never moves, instead the world moves around the player. To you it looks like you are landing on a planet, but in reality, the planet is landing on you.<br>
            The game effectively uses the fact that even in the real-world velocity is relative. When you walk backwards in a train you feel like you are moving in that direction, but compared to the earth you are still moving in the opposite direction. That is because you perceive your direction of movement relative to the train.

        <h1>Alien Isolation</h1>
        <p>Alien isolation is a masterclass of using sound to build ambience. In the story you are stranded on a ship in space with a hungry alien monster that is unkillable. It is known as one of the scarier horror games. Despite this reputation and story, you rarely see the alien. So how can it be so scarry then?<br>
            Once again, the answer is rather simple, you hear it constantly hunting you. The alien crawls trough the ships ventilation system listening for you. This fosters a sense of paranoia in the player, jumping at every sound you hear because you never know when the alien will leave the vents and force you to hide in a locker or under a table while the alien walks around the room sniffing the air.<br>
            The developers then later enhance this feeling of dread by making you the player crawl the vents to progress the game. By this point you are conditioned to think of the vents as the alien’s territory. This is the genius of letting the player scare themselves.

        <h1>Baldur’s Gate III</h1>
        <p>Baldur’s gate III (BG3) is ingenious, not because the developers used any clever solutions like the previous games, but because they stuck to something that had been proven to work and combining it with a lot of player agency in how the story progresses.<br>
            BG3 uses almost the exact mechanics of Dungeons & Dragons 5th (DnD) edition. DnD is a great game because no two sessions will ever be the same when you play it. In DnD you have to have at least 2 people but there is no theoretical max. One player is always what is known as a GM or DM (short for Game Master or Dungeon Master) they basically play the world that the other players play a single character in.<br>
            BG3 adapts this concept in a way where the game sort of replaces the GM and plays the world while you control up to 4 characters. This gives the game a well designed and balanced system for interacting with the world, whether it is in negotiations, intimidation or combat.<br>
            The thing that makes BG3 noteworthy is however not this but the amount of influence the player has on the story. You can be a bad guy and help the “enemy” or side with the innocents. You can ignore the conflicts altogether if you want to, it is all up to the dice and your decisions.
