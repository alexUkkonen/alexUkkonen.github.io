    <h1>From Sandcastles to Virtual Worlds: The Rise of the Modern Game</h1>
    <p>Games have always been about creating entertaining or meaningful experiences. Many hundreds of thousands of games have been created through time. Most are forgotten to time, but some sur-vive a millennium. Good examples of these games are football and basketball. Children have been playing with sand since the inception of humanity, but even with this rich history the golden age of games is probably just starting.</p>
    <p>Up until now we have been limited by what is possible within the confine of the laws of physics, this is no more with the invention of video games. You can be anywhere, live any story and do anything you can imagine. This has created thousands of jobs as we humans seek further entertainment.</p>
    <p>This website is focused on explaining and talking about what makes these games so great. Some of its bay be technical, some may be spoilers for great games, but this will always be preceded by a warning.</p>

    <h1>What is a single-player game?</h1>
    <p>What is a single-player game? This is both an easy and hard question to answer. Single player games are games that you play by yourself. But this surprisingly presents a new challenge. Some games have optional Co-op, some have a hub where you can see other players. Are these still sin-gle-player games?<br> is up to your own interpretation, but I define a single-player game as any game where the developers have prioritised the experience of playing alone. This means that games like risk of rain 2 donâ€™t count, but games like Ghost Recon: Wildlands do. This should help us understand what I refer to when I say single-player game.</p>
