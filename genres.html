        <h1>Single-player Design</h1>

        <h2>What do singleplayer games look like?</h2>
        <p>Singleplayer games come in many forms. But for this article we will be ignoring games that could be performed in real life easily, like solitaire. Other than that, you have games like Clannad, one of the greatest visual novels of all time. </p>

                    <h2>Visual Novels (VN)</h2>
                    <p>
                        Visual Novels are novels with images in the background utilizing character sprites with which to enhance the experience. Think of it as combining art and text. Clannad as a story is 80 hours long with 14 different endings, or so called “routes”, and once you have completed every route in the game you unlock the legendary after story.

                    <h2>RPG/Open-world games</h2>
                    <p>
                        This genre is usually made up of free experiences where you can choose an order in which you experience the story, with massive open worlds where you can go where you want, when you want. Prominent examples would be the Witcher series and a game like Nier Automata. There is a lot of variation, some are open in name only and railroad you while giving you the illusion that they are open. <br>
                        A lot of these games are characterized by big open and beautiful landscapes and complicated sto-ries with the option for co-op. You almost always have AI companions in these games, and it is quite easy for the developers to replace one of these with a player.<br>
                        The main difference between an RPG and a VN is that in an RPG you play an actual character in the world, and this enables you to move around. By extension it means more gameplay mechanics can be implemented<br>
                        Usually, you will also be able to build your own character and tailor their playstyle to your liking by leveling skills and magic. The selling point is usually shaping the story and world to your liking and being able to play the game how you want. A good example of a game that does this well is Baldur’s Gate III (BG3). In BG3 you can select a premade character or make your own selection from various races. You can choose to be a good hero, a neutral nomad or someone who works for evil through the choices you make in the game.<br>
                        you can read more on BG3 here (<a href="game_spotlight.html#BG3">Game spotlight: Baldur's gare 3</a>)

                    <h2>Mystery/Puzzle games</h2>
                    <p>
                        When I say puzzle games, I am not referring to literal puzzles, but challenges where you must solve something to progress. Mystery games are kind of like a mystery book where you must solve an overarching story. The best example of a great mystery game is Outer wilds. It is a game where you are stuck in a time loop and must solve why by collecting clues in each loop. You can travel freely and go anywhere in any order. I’ll talk more about Outer wilds in 
                        (<a href="game_spotlight.html#outer_wilds">Game spotligth: Outer wilds</a>)<br>
                        As for puzzle games, these are typically made as co-op games or are part of a story driven RPG, but a good example of a puzzle game is Portal 1. Portal 2 is also good, but it was primarily made as a co-op game.

                    <h2>Horror games</h2>
                    <p>
                        Speaking of puzzles, horror games are some of the most popular single-player games on the mar-ket. These usually fall into 3 broad categories. The action-horror games, the survival-horror games and the puzzle-horror games. Action-horror games usually center around fighting monsters, wheth-er it be the aliens and infected humans in the Dead-Space series, literal demons in the Doom games or the classic zombies and mutants/horrors in the Resident Evil series.<br>
                        In puzzle horror games you must solve, well, puzzles. Usually these are psychological horror fo-cused games. A good example of a game like this is Silent Hill 2. In silent hill you solve puzzles while avoiding or killing monsters that roam the streets. Sometimes the puzzles are straightforward challenges, where other times they are about killing an “unkillable” monster.<br>
                        Last but certainly not least we have survival horror games. This category is classified by having a lot of apocalypse survival games, but usually the best ones are the ones where the game heavily leans into stealth. A perfect example of this is Alien Isolation. In Alien Isolation you play as a survi-vor on a ship with an Alien (see picture below). You have to avoid the alien and scavenge items to escape and hopefully kill it. This game will also be talked about further in 
                        (<a href="game_spotlight.html#alien_isolation">Game spotligth: Alien: isolation</a>).

                    <h2>Simulation games</h2>
                    <p>
                        Simulation games are a quite straight forward concept. They simply simulate an aspect of real life as accurately as possible, whether it is farming (Farming simulator series), trucking (Euro truck simulator), The Sims simulating a household (although not that accurately), Kerbal space program simulating aerodynamics and rocket science extremely accurately, etcetera. I think you get the gist, you want to try something? There is a simulator game for it.

                    <h2>Platformers</h2>
                    <p>Platformers are some of the most well-known games containing games like Super Mario, Sonic and Mega Man. Platformers have not evolved too much since then. Of course, new mechanics have been invented, but ultimately, they all end up quite similar. Personally, my favorite platformer is Blaz Blue: Entropy Effect here after referred to as Entropy Effect.<br>
                    Entropy Effect is a platformer like all before it, but it is also a rouge-like game. It isn’t the first to do this, but what makes it stand out in my mind is the fact that it has been made as a spin-off to a fighting game called Blaz Blue. This has the effect of making combos important and by adding a lot of precise mechanics.
